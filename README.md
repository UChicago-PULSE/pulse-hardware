# pulse-hardware
This is the central repository for documents related to PULSE-A hardware development. 

## PULSE-A CAD Models
PULSE-A is almost entirely developed within Autodesk Fusion360, which does not provide concrete or consistent methods for file storage that can be taken advantage of by Git. Until a good method of archiving Fusion files is found, a link to the current model of PULSE-A is available [here](https://a360.co/3sMOkbg). Please let us know if this link is broken.

## HSFL Artemis
Everything in `artemis-hardware/` is just a copy of material gathered from HSFL, who have helped us greatly in making this project possible.
