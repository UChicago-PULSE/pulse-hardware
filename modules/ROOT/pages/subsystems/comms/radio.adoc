= Radio

We are using the link:https://www.spacemanic.com/murgas-uhf-vhf-transceiver/[Space Maniac Murgas transceiver] to
receive radio transmission from the RF Ground Station, which is essential component of Pointing Acquisition and tracking of satellite.

It receives 1 of 4 PPS signals from LMK1C1104 fanout buffer chip that fans out PPS signal from Space Maniac GNSS Receiver module. The Fanout Chip is situated on the Radio-GPS PCB.

The EXT_RST pin is connected directly to the EXT_RST pin of Space Maniac GNSS Receiver via the Radio-GPS PCB.
Command : `erst` causes a signal output from EXT_RST pin that resets all Space Maniac modules.

== Protocol:
I2C and CAN will be used to pass commands from the transceiver.
The output of Radio Module is received and directed to the CAN and I2C bus via the Radio-GPS PCB.
