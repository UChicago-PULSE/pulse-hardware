= Global Positioning System (GPS)

We are using the link:https://www.spacemanic.com/celeste-gnss-receiver/[Space Maniac Celeste GNSS Receiver] as the GPS for the satellite. It receives GPS location and precise timing data from GNSS satellites.


== Notable Pins
PPS pin: Outputs a one pulse per second signal used for disciplining the internal clocks of different modules. Each pulse means the passing of a second. This output is passed to the Radio-GPS PCB to be fanned out to supply to the OBC, Payload Controller, ADCS and Radio. Every PPS signal is accompanied with a Timestamp that is sent through CAN and I2C bus.

EXT_RST: The SpaceManiac Murgas Radio Tranceiver has capability to reset this module, so this pin is connected to EXT_RST of Radio via the Radio-GPS PCB.
