= Quadcell Amplifier

The quadcell amplifier is a variation of a transimpedance amplifier meant to take the current output from the QPD and amplify it to readable signals and passed into a 24-bit ADC where digital signals can then be wired from there to the payload controller. 

There are two stages to the amplifier. The first is a traditional transimpedance amplifier with a large feedback resistor to achieve the necessary voltages.

The second is another amplifier
