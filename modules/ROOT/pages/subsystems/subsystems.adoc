= Subsystem Overview

The flight hardware is organized into five subsystems which encompass the essential functions of our satellite hardware

== Subsystems:
[circle]
* Command and Data Handling (CDH): For the "brain" of the satellite and managing all onboard operations and subsystems by sending commands and redistributing data to necessary recipients.
* Communications: For all ground to satellite communications. This subsystem is composed of the radio and dipole antenna on the satellite.
* Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC): For all pointing and position acquisition hardware such as the ADCS components and the GPS receiver.
* Payload: For all additional electronics hardware necessary in the payload box that controls or assists with the payload.
* Power: For managing power on the satellite from the solar panels to our batteries to distribution along the PC/104 header to everything on the stack.
